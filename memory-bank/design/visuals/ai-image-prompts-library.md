## Advanced Customization Techniques

### Style Consistency Method
Once you have a master image you like, use these techniques:

**1. Reference Image Style:**
```
[Your prompt] --sref [URL of master image] --sw 100
```

**2. Use Same Seed:**
```
[Your prompt] --seed 12345
```

**3. Combine Both:**
```
[Your prompt] --sref [URL] --sw 100 --seed 12345
```

### Variation Control

**Subtle Variations:**
```
[Your prompt] --chaos 10 --style raw
```

**More Creative Variations:**
```
[Your prompt] --chaos 50 --style raw
```

**Consistent Style:**
```
[Your prompt] --chaos 0 --stylize 50 --style raw
```

### Aspect Ratio Guide

| Section | Recommended AR | Flag |

## Quality Parameters Explained

### Stylization (--s)
- `--s 0`: Literal interpretation, least artistic
- `--s 50`: Balanced (RECOMMENDED for corporate)
- `--s 100`: Default, moderate styling
- `--s 250`: More artistic interpretation
- `--s 1000`: Maximum Midjourney style

**For Roaya IT: Use `--s 50` for professional, literal results**

### Quality (--q)
- `--q 0.25`: Fast, lower quality
- `--q 0.5`: Balanced speed/quality
- `--q 1`: Default quality
- `--q 2`: Highest quality (RECOMMENDED for finals)

**For Roaya IT: Use `--q 2` for final production images**

### Chaos (--chaos)
- `--chaos 0`: Very consistent results
- `--chaos 25`: Slight variations (RECOMMENDED)
- `--chaos 50`: More creative variations
- `--chaos 100`: Maximum variation

**For Roaya IT: Use `--chaos 0-25` for consistency**

---

## Post-Processing Workflow

### After Generation in Midjourney

1. **Upscale:** Always upscale to 4x (U1, U2, U3, or U4 buttons)
2. **Vary:** If close but not perfect, use "Vary (Strong)" or "Vary (Subtle)"
3. **Download:** Download at maximum resolution

### Optimization Steps

1. **Remove Background (if needed):**
   - Use https://remove.bg for objects/icons
   - Use Photoshop/Photopea for complex selections

2. **Color Adjustment:**
   - Ensure brand colors match exactly
   - Adjust saturation if needed
   - Verify consistency across all images

3. **Convert to WebP:**
   ```bash
   cwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp
   ```

4. **Create Responsive Variants:**
   - Desktop: 1920px width
   - Tablet: 1024px width
   - Mobile: 640px width

5. **Optimize File Size:**
   - Target: <200KB per image
   - Use compression tools: TinyPNG, Squoosh

## Budget & Usage Tracking

### Midjourney Basic Plan ($10/month)
- ~200 fast generations
- Unlimited relaxed generations (slower)
- Commercial license included

### Recommended Allocation for Roaya IT

| Section | Fast Gens | Relaxed Gens | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Master Style | 10 | 0 | Critical - need quick iteration |
| Hero Options | 15 | 10 | Test multiple approaches |
| Service Sections | 12 | 15 | 3-4 images x 3 sections |
| Industry Solutions | 10 | 10 | 3 industries + triptych |
| Backgrounds | 5 | 20 | Less critical timing |
| Icons | 8 | 15 | Can use relaxed mode |
| **Total** | **60** | **70** | Fits in 1-month plan |

### Pro Tips for Efficiency

1. **Batch Similar Prompts:** Generate all cloud-related images in one session
2. **Use Relaxed Mode:** For non-critical background patterns
3. **Upscale Selectively:** Only upscale images you'll definitely use
4. **Vary Instead of Regenerate:** Use variation tools to iterate faster
5. **Save Seeds:** Document successful seeds for future consistency

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Colors Don't Match Brand
**Solution:** Be more explicit with hex codes in prompt
```
exact color navy blue hex #3D5A80, exact color teal hex #5DB7C2
```

### Issue: Too Artistic/Stylized
**Solution:** Reduce stylization parameter
```
--s 25 --style raw
```

### Issue: Inconsistent Style Across Images
**Solution:** Use seed + style reference
```
--seed [number] --sref [first-image-URL] --sw 100
```

### Issue: Text Appearing in Images
**Solution:** Add to prompt
```
no text, no letters, no typography
```

### Issue: Wrong Aspect Ratio After Generation
**Solution:** Use zoom out or pan features, or regenerate with correct --ar flag
