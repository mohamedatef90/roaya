### Week 1-2: Problem Awareness (Educational + Thought Leadership)

#### Post 1: The Contrarian Hook
```
Stop hiring more security tools.

I've seen companies with 47 different security products.
And they still got breached.

Here's what they were missing:

Intelligence.

Tools generate alerts.
Experts investigate alerts.
AI correlates alerts.

But most vendors give you tools and call it "AI-powered."

What enterprises actually need:

1. Expert judgment at every decision point
2. AI that correlates findings across domains
3. Attack-path analysis spanning identity, cloud, and applications
4. Results your board can understand

That's not a tool. That's a security partner.

If your current vendor's "AI" is just prettier dashboards,
it might be time for a conversation.

---

What's the most useless security tool you've ever bought?
Drop it in the comments. I'll go first.

#### Post 2: The Data Hook (Carousel)
```
Slide 1 (Cover):
"I analyzed 500+ security assessments in Egypt.
Here's what nobody wants to talk about."

Slide 2:
73% of enterprises had at least one critical vulnerability
that scanners marked as "informational."

Slide 3:
The average time from breach to detection in MENA?
287 days.
(Global average: 194 days)

Slide 4:
60% of "clean" pen test reports
were missing attack-path analysis entirely.

Slide 5:
Only 12% of security reports
included business impact translation.

Slide 6:
The pattern?
Too much automation.
Not enough intelligence.

Slide 7:
What separates good security from great?
- Expert-led analysis
- AI-assisted correlation
- Attack-path narratives
- Executive-ready reporting

Slide 8 (CTA):
At Roaya, we've delivered 500+ security validations
with AI that assists experts - not replaces them.

Want to see the difference?
Comment "INTEL" and I'll send you a sample report.

#### Post 3: Story Hook
```
3 years ago, I got a call at 2 AM.

"We've been breached. Our data is on the dark web."

The client was a major Egyptian bank.
They had 12 security tools.
Annual penetration tests from a big-name vendor.
"Clean" audit reports.

What they didn't have:
- Anyone correlating signals across their systems
- Attack-path analysis showing how attackers moved
- Real-time threat hunting
- Anyone who could answer "how did this happen?"

That night changed everything for me.

I realized: most security is theater.
Checklists. Tool output. Compliance checkboxes.

Real security is intelligence.
Understanding how attackers think.
Correlating findings that tools miss.
Telling a story the board can act on.

That's why we built our AI-assisted approach.
Not to replace experts.
To make them faster, smarter, more effective.

If you're responsible for enterprise security,
ask yourself:
"Would my current vendor know how to answer at 2 AM?"

---

Have you ever discovered something your scanner missed?
I'd love to hear about it.

### Week 3-4: Solution Introduction (Educational + Promotional)

#### Post 4: Value Promise Hook (Carousel)
```
Slide 1 (Cover):
"Save this: 7 Things Your Pen Test Report Should Include
(But Probably Doesn't)"

Slide 2:
1. Attack-Path Narratives
Not just "vulnerability found" - but "here's how an attacker
chains 3 low-risk findings into a critical breach."

Slide 3:
2. AI-Prioritized Findings
Ranked by actual exploitability and business impact,
not just CVSS scores.

Slide 4:
3. Control Validation
Did your security controls detect our tests?
If not, why not?

Slide 5:
4. Executive Summary in Plain Language
"Your customer data is at risk" > "SQLi found in parameter X"

Slide 6:
5. Realistic Attack Scenarios
What would APT29 do with these findings?
What about a disgruntled employee?

Slide 7:
6. Remediation Prioritization
Fix what matters first.
Not 200 "highs" with no guidance.

Slide 8:
7. Framework Mapping
MITRE ATT&CK. NIST CSF. ISO 27001.
Audit-ready, not an afterthought.

Slide 9 (CTA):
Want to see what AI-assisted security validation looks like?

DM "SAMPLE" for a redacted report example.

#PenetrationTesting #Cybersecurity #Egypt #CISO
```

**Visual:** Clean numbered list design, each slide with icon and brief text, navy/teal brand colors

---

#### Post 5: Challenge Hook
```
I dare you to ask your security vendor these 5 questions:

1. "Show me an attack path, not a vulnerability list."
   (If they can't map how findings combine, they're tool-dependent)

2. "How does your AI actually work?"
   (If the answer is "machine learning" with no details, it's marketing)

3. "What will your report tell my board?"
   (If it's just technical findings, it's not enterprise-ready)

4. "Do your findings map to MITRE ATT&CK?"
   (If not, they're not speaking the industry language)

5. "What happens if you find something critical?"
   (If there's no escalation process, they're not partners - they're contractors)

---

Most vendors hate these questions.
Because the answers expose the gap between marketing and delivery.

At Roaya, we welcome them.

Our approach:
- Expert-led, AI-assisted delivery
- Attack-path intelligence across identity, cloud, applications
- Executive-ready reporting with framework mapping
- Real partnership, not just annual contracts

If your vendor can't answer these,
let's talk.

### Week 5-6: Social Proof & Differentiation

#### Post 6: Proof Hook (Case Study)
```
One engagement. 6 findings. 2 boardroom presentations.

A major Egyptian financial institution came to us with a problem:

"We've had 3 pen tests in 2 years. All clean.
But our CISO doesn't trust the results."

Here's what we found that others missed:

Finding 1: AD privilege escalation path
(Hidden across 4 systems, invisible to automated scans)

Finding 2: API authentication bypass
(Required manual testing + business logic understanding)

Finding 3: Cloud misconfiguration chain
(3 "low" findings that combined into critical access)

Finding 4: Identity federation weakness
(Only visible through attack-path analysis)

Finding 5: Mobile app credential exposure
(Needed reverse engineering + runtime manipulation)

Finding 6: Legacy system lateral movement
(Required deep infrastructure knowledge)

The difference?

Previous vendors: Tool output + consultant review
Our approach: Expert-led + AI-assisted correlation

The CISO's reaction:
"For the first time, I can explain our risk to the board
without drowning them in technical jargon."

---

If "clean" pen test reports make you nervous,
your instincts might be right.

#### Post 7: Industry Insight
```
Unpopular opinion:

Most SOC services in Egypt are glorified log watchers.

Here's the typical setup:
- SIEM collecting logs
- Analysts reviewing alerts
- Tickets opened for "investigation"
- Monthly reports showing "events processed"

What's missing?

1. Threat hunting
   Not waiting for alerts - actively looking for adversaries

2. Attack correlation
   Understanding how 10 unrelated events = 1 attack chain

3. Response capability
   Can they contain a threat at 3 AM, or just escalate?

4. Intelligence integration
   Are they using MITRE ATT&CK? OSINT? Dark web monitoring?

5. Business context
   Do they know what your crown jewels are?

---

A SOC that just watches logs is an expensive false sense of security.

A SOC that hunts, correlates, responds, and understands your business?
That's an actual security operation.

Questions to ask your SOC provider:
- "What's your mean time to detect?"
- "Show me a threat hunting report."
- "What happens when you find something at 2 AM?"

If the answers are vague, your organization might be exposed.

### Week 7-8: Conversion & CTA Focus

#### Post 8: Urgency Hook
```
The average ransomware attack in MENA costs $4.5M.

Response time breakdown:
- Hour 1-4: Containment window (40% of damage prevented)
- Hour 4-24: Escalation phase (60% of data at risk)
- Day 2+: Recovery mode (full business impact)

Do you have an incident response plan?
More importantly - do you have a team ready to execute it?

Here's what we've learned from 100+ incident engagements:

1. Companies with retainers respond 3x faster
2. AI-assisted analysis cuts investigation time by 50%
3. NIST-aligned processes reduce regulatory exposure
4. Digital forensics preserves evidence for legal action

If you're waiting until the breach to find a response partner,
you've already lost critical hours.

---

We offer two engagement models:

Emergency Response (On-Demand)
- 24/7 hotline
- <2 hour response
- Expert team deployed immediately

Retainer Program
- Pre-negotiated terms
- Dedicated response team familiar with your environment
- Proactive readiness assessments

Which one is right for your organization?

Comment "READY" and I'll share our incident response readiness checklist.

#### Post 9: Final CTA Post
```
Security validation at this level is a strategic engagement.

If you're responsible for:
- Enterprise infrastructure and platforms
- Core financial or government systems
- Business-critical mobile or digital services
- Regulatory, operational, or executive accountability

You need more than a vendor.
You need a security partner who speaks your language.

What we deliver:
AI-Assisted Intelligence, Not Automated Noise
Expert Judgment at Every Decision Point
Full Attack Surface Coverage
Executive-Ready Reporting
Framework Alignment (NIST, ISO, MITRE)
Secure Handling of Sensitive Findings

What we don't do:
- Tool dumps disguised as reports
- Generic checklists
- "AI-powered" marketing without substance
- One-size-fits-all packages

---

If this resonates, let's talk.

Comment "EXPERT" or DM me directly.

We'll scope the engagement correctly and provide an AI-assisted,
expert-led plan aligned with your organization's needs.

No sales pressure. No generic proposals.
Just a conversation about your security posture.
