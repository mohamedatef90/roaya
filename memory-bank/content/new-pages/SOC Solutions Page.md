# 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) Services

Stop chasing alerts and focus on real risks. **Roaya’s 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC)**
services take continuous monitoring off your team, so you can focus on the business. We
deliver 24/7 threat detection, investigation, and response aligned to **NIST CSF** , **ISO
27001/27002** , **MITRE ATT&CK** , and **CIS Controls** to help **reduce cyber risk exposure**.

As a managed SOC provider in Egypt and across MENA, Roaya delivers SOC-as-a-Service
with experts on watch 24/7 to **catch incidents early and limit impact**. We use **AI-assisted
detection and triage** to reduce false alarms, correlate signals, and speed response — while
keeping telemetry and incident data protected using our own AI models on **our cloud
infrastructure**.

## What You Get with Roaya SOC

**Business outcomes first.** Roaya’s managed SOC translates security operations into
measurable risk reduction:

## How It Works: Ingest, Detect, Respond, Report


Continuous 24/7 monitoring: Analysts watch your environment day and night — including
weekends and holidays — so threats can’t slip through when internal teams are offline.
Faster detection and response: We investigate and contain threats quickly to minimize
downtime and loss, following NIST SP 800-61 escalation and incident handling from alert
through recovery.
Reduced noise, real threats prioritized: AI-driven correlation filters benign events and
consolidates related alerts into fewer, higher-priority incidents — reducing alert fatigue and
accelerating investigations.
Expert-led remediation: We provide clear containment guidance and, in higher tiers, can
execute response actions (based on pre-approved playbooks). Incidents are documented to
support improvement and compliance needs.
Peace of mind and compliance support: Detailed reporting and evidence help
demonstrate governance and satisfy monitoring/response requirements tied to standards
like ISO 27001.

Roaya blends modern platforms (SIEM, XDR, SOAR) with analyst-led operations:

Throughout the workflow, AI accelerates correlation and prioritization, while **humans stay in
control**. AI processing uses our models on **our cloud infrastructure** , keeping your data private
and away from public AI services.

## SOC Packages at a Glance

All tiers include **24/7 monitoring** and a **SIEM foundation**. Higher tiers add deeper coverage
and response:

### SOC Essential

**Best for:** foundational 24/7 monitoring and alerting.
Includes SIEM monitoring, analyst triage, incident notification with guidance, and monthly
reporting. Works with your existing SIEM (e.g., **QRadar** , **Splunk** , **Elastic** ) or Roaya-managed
SIEM.

### SOC Advanced

1. **Ingest & Monitor:** We ingest logs and telemetry across network, servers, cloud, endpoints,
    and applications into a **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** foundation.
    If you already use **Cortex XSIAM** , **Splunk** , or **Elastic Security** , we integrate with them; if
    not, we provide a SIEM baseline.
2. **Correlate & Analyze (AI-Assisted):** Our Cortex-led approach correlates events and
    applies AI analytics to surface anomalies and attack patterns. Centralizing signals improves
    context and streamlines operations.
3. **Triage & Prioritization:** Alerts are triaged quickly. Machine learning reduces noise by
    filtering benign events and consolidating alerts into incident tickets. Analysts validate
    severity and remove remaining false positives.
4. **Investigate & Hunt:** Investigators dig deeper using threat intelligence such as **Palo Alto**
    **Networks Unit 42**. If enabled, threat hunting uses hypotheses and **MITRE ATT&CK** to
    uncover stealthy activity.
5. **Respond & Contain:** Based on your tier, we provide containment guidance or take direct
    action (e.g., isolate endpoints, block malicious IPs, disable compromised accounts). Actions
    follow pre-approved playbooks aligned to **NIST SP 800-**.
6. **Report & Improve:** You receive incident reporting, post-incident review, and ongoing
    service reports (alerts, incidents, response times, trends). Reviews also drive tuning and
    continuous improvement.


**Best for:** broader visibility and deeper investigations.
Adds additional log sources (cloud, AD, SaaS), behavior analytics, enriched threat intel (e.g.,
**Unit 42** , **IBM** , **Kaspersky** ), deeper incident analysis, tuning, and enhanced reporting/portal
access.

### Managed Detection & Response (MDR)

**Best for:** active containment, especially endpoint-led threats.
Adds managed **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)** with active response actions (e.g.,
isolate devices, kill malicious processes) using platforms like **Palo Alto Cortex XDR** or
**CrowdStrike** , plus full incident lifecycle support and higher-touch reviews.

### Extended Detection & Response (XDR)

**Best for:** unified detection and response across the entire environment.
Extends coverage across endpoints, network, cloud, and identity, and is built on **Palo Alto
Networks Cortex XSIAM** (converged SIEM/SOAR/ASM/XDR with Precision AI). Includes
automated response with human oversight, anomaly-driven analytics, and broader attack
surface monitoring.

### Threat Hunting (Add-on)

Optional for any tier. Proactive, hypothesis-driven hunts mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK** , using your
available data sources to uncover threats that evade standard detection.

_Not sure what fits?_ Roaya can assess your environment and recommend the right level of
coverage.

## Threat Hunting & Integrations

Roaya’s SOC is **vendor-agnostic and highly integrative**. We work with your current stack and
add capabilities where needed — without locking you into a single toolset.

We commonly integrate with:

```
Palo Alto Networks (Cortex, Cortex XSIAM , Unit 42)
IBM QRadar , Splunk , Elastic Security
F
CrowdStrike , FortiGuard , Kaspersky
Vulnerability context from tools like Nessus
```

These are common integrations — not limits. We use a broader set of tools and methods to
ensure coverage and operational fit.

Threat hunting can be scheduled (monthly/quarterly) or run on demand. If hunts uncover
evidence of compromise, we escalate immediately through your SOC workflow.

## Standards Alignment & Best Practices

Roaya aligns SOC operations to globally recognized frameworks to ensure consistent,
auditable delivery:

This alignment helps you connect operational security outcomes to governance and compliance
requirements.
