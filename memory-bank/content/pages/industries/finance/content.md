## Industry Challenges Section

### Headline
Critical IT Challenges Facing Egyptian Banks and Financial Institutions

### Challenge 1: Central Bank of Egypt Compliance Requirements
**Meeting Strict Data Sovereignty Regulations**

The Central Bank of Egypt mandates local data hosting for all financial institutions. International cloud providers cannot guarantee compliance with CBE directives on data residency, disaster recovery locations, and regulatory reporting. Non-compliance risks operational licenses and substantial penalties.

### Challenge 2: 24/7 Availability Expectations
**Zero Tolerance for Downtime**

Banking customers expect round-the-clock access to services. Every minute of downtime translates to lost transactions, damaged reputation, and regulatory scrutiny. Traditional infrastructure struggles to deliver the 99.9%+ uptime that modern banking demands.

### Challenge 3: Escalating Cyber Threats
**Financial Sector Under Constant Attack**

Egyptian banks face an average of 340 cyberattacks per week, targeting customer accounts, payment systems, and sensitive financial data. Legacy security tools cannot detect sophisticated threats like ransomware, phishing campaigns, and insider attacks that specifically target financial institutions.

### Challenge 4: Legacy System Modernization
**Outdated Infrastructure Holding Back Innovation**

Core banking systems running on decades-old technology create bottlenecks for digital transformation. Migrating to cloud infrastructure while maintaining operational continuity and data integrity presents significant technical and business risk.

### Challenge 5: PCI DSS Compliance Complexity
**Payment Security Standards Require Continuous Monitoring**

PCI DSS compliance demands continuous security monitoring, quarterly scans, annual audits, and strict access controls. Managing compliance internally requires dedicated teams, specialized tools, and constant vigilance that diverts resources from core banking operations.
