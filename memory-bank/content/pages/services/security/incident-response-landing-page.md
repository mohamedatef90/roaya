### When Every Minute Counts, We Bring Clarity

When an incident hits, the goal is simple: **contain the impact, restore operations, and prevent it from happening again.**

Roaya delivers 24/7 Incident Response (IR) and Digital Forensics with a calm, decisive process built for real business pressure.

> Minutes matter — but panic doesn't help. We bring structure, disciplined evidence handling, and clear decision-making.

aligned to NIST SP 800-61 guidance for incident handling and recovery. NIST emphasizes integrating incident response into risk management to reduce the number and impact of incidents and improve detection, response, and recovery effectiveness.

### From the first call to the final report
Roaya uses AI-assisted analysis to accelerate scoping, correlate signals across logs/endpoints/network data, and support timeline reconstruction while maintaining forensic rigor. AI assists; conclusions are expert-validated and documented. Roaya runs its AI models on our secure cloud infrastructure, so incident evidence and artifacts remain protected and under our control.

## When to Call

You don't need a confirmed "breach" to call. **Reach out when the situation is unclear and the risk is real.**

### Common Triggers

- A sudden outage, ransomware encryption event, or ransom note
- Unusual account activity (mass lockouts, unexpected password resets, "impossible travel," access at odd hours)
- Suspected sensitive data exposure (customer records, payroll, contracts, source code)
- Security tools firing high-severity alerts you can't quickly validate
- A compromised laptop/server, suspicious remote access, or unknown new admin accounts
- Third-party notification that your credentials or data may have been exposed
- Needing defensible forensics for internal, regulatory, or cyber insurance requirements

**If you're unsure, we scope first, then act decisively.**

## Engagement Options

### On-Demand Incident Response

**Best for:** A live incident or urgent suspicion that needs immediate triage and containment.

**What's included:**

- 24/7 availability and rapid mobilization
- Initial scoping and impact assessment
- Containment support to stop spread and limit downtime
- Forensic collection and analysis (endpoint, network, logs, cloud)
- Action-oriented eradication and recovery recommendations
- Post-incident report with root cause, lessons learned, and hardening priorities

---

### Incident Response Retainer

**Best for:** Faster response and less friction when the next incident happens.

A retainer is a simple idea: pre-agree terms, contacts, access methods, and runbooks so you're not negotiating during an outage. It's on-demand access with pre-negotiated terms for smoother, faster response.

**What's included:**

- Priority 24/7 access to IR and forensics support
- Pre-incident readiness (escalation paths, evidence handling, communications plan)
- Faster onboarding during a real event (known systems, stakeholders, workflows)
- Optional tabletop exercises and response playbook tuning
- Retainer credits applied to incident response and proactive risk-reduction activities (as scoped)

## How We Respond

Roaya's approach is grounded in **NIST SP 800-61** incident-handling concepts, mapped into clear operational steps.

### Response Steps

#### 1. Prepare
Confirm contacts, access paths, evidence handling, and decision authority; validate logging/telemetry and preservation steps.

#### 2. Detect & Analyze
Triage, confirm what's real vs. noise, scope affected users/systems/data/timeline; map behaviors using MITRE ATT&CK.

#### 3. Contain, Eradicate & Recover
Isolate affected systems, block malicious activity, stop lateral movement; remove persistence, reset credentials, patch root causes; restore services safely, validate integrity, and monitor for re-entry.

#### 4. Post-Incident Activity
Deliver a defensible report, root cause analysis, and prioritized recommendations; convert lessons learned into measurable improvements.

## AI-Assisted, Human-Led Execution

We use AI to move faster without compromising rigor:

- Faster scoping through clustering of alerts and artifacts
- Evidence correlation across endpoints, network traces, and logs
- Timeline reconstruction to sequence attacker actions and impacted assets
- Support for repeatable containment actions (always human-approved)

**Every conclusion is reviewed and documented by experienced responders.**

## Digital Forensics Capabilities

Digital forensics answers the questions that matter: *What happened? How? What data was accessed? What should we do next?*

We collect and analyze evidence with a defensible chain-of-custody mindset.

### Memory Forensics
**Tools:** Volatility, FTK Imager  
Reveals running malware, injected code, and in-memory credentials; identifies active tooling not written to disk.

### Disk and File Forensics
**Tools:** Autopsy, Sleuth Kit, EnCase  
Reconstructs file activity and persistence; supports root cause analysis and evidence preservation.

### Log and Endpoint Telemetry Analysis
**Tools:** Chainsaw, Velociraptor  
Speeds triage across logs and artifacts; helps identify escalation, suspicious execution, and persistence at scale.

### Network Forensics
**Tools:** Wireshark, Zeek  
Identifies command-and-control and exfiltration patterns; adds context when endpoint logs are incomplete.

### Rapid Triage & Artifact Collection
**Tools:** KAPE, Eric Zimmerman's tools  
Collects high-value artifacts fast to support early containment decisions and preserve evidence.

## Tools & Intelligence Ecosystem

Incidents don't live in one tool. Roaya connects the dots across your stack to shorten time-to-resolution.

**We integrate signals from:**

- Palo Alto Networks ecosystem (including Cortex and Unit 42 threat intelligence)
- SIEM and analytics platforms: Cortex XSIAM, Splunk, Elastic
- Network and application controls: F5
- Endpoint and threat intel: CrowdStrike, FortiGuard, Kaspersky
- Vulnerability context: Nessus

*Tools listed are representative — we use a broader set of proven IR and forensic tools as needed to ensure complete coverage.*

## Standards Alignment & Compliance

Roaya's IR and forensics work is designed to fit into your broader governance and audit posture.

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **NIST CSF** | Ties response into an enterprise risk and resilience framework |
| **ISO/IEC 27001 & 27002** | Supports structured policies, controls, and repeatable processes |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | Maps observed behaviors to known adversary techniques |
| **CIS Controls** | Converts lessons learned into prioritized control improvements |
| **Global Regulations** | Investigations conducted in compliance with GDPR and applicable local regulations |

*Alignment matters because it creates consistency: during chaos, everyone knows what "good" looks like.*
