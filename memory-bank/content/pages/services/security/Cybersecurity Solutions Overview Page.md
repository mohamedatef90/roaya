### Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Management

Roaya’s ethical hacking team **simulates real-world attacks** on your networks, applications, and cloud systems to uncover weaknesses before attackers do. We conduct thorough **penetration testing and vulnerability assessment** services, then provide clear remediation guidance prioritized by risk. This helps you fix the most critical issues first, reducing your exposure and strengthening your security posture.

### Incident Response & Digital Forensics

When cyber incidents strike, **every second counts**. Our **incident response services** are on standby 24/7 to help you investigate and contain breaches. We follow the **NIST SP 800-61** incident response lifecycle – from Preparation and Detection to Containment, Eradication, and Recovery – to handle incidents in a structured, efficient manner. Through **digital forensics**, we identify root causes and preserve evidence, helping you learn from attacks and meet any legal or compliance obligations.
