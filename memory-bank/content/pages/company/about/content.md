For too long, Egyptian businesses have struggled with IT providers who hide pricing, over-promise capabilities, and deliver inconsistent support. We're changing that.

Roaya IT was founded on a simple belief: Egyptian businesses deserve the same level of IT service transparency and quality available to Fortune 500 companies worldwide. By partnering with WorldPosta—a global leader in cloud infrastructure and email hosting—we bring enterprise-grade technology to the Egyptian market with the personalized service of a local partner.

**Global Standards**
Powered by WorldPosta's infrastructure across 35+ data center zones worldwide, we deliver the same reliability and performance trusted by international enterprises.

**Measurable Results**
We guarantee business outcomes, not just technical features. Our ROI calculator shows expected savings before you commit, and we back our solutions with clear SLAs.

## Our Story Section

### Headline: "Built for the Egyptian Market"

**Content:**

Roaya IT was founded by IT professionals who spent years working with both international cloud providers and Egyptian enterprises.

- Local providers lacking enterprise-grade infrastructure
- Businesses unable to build accurate IT budgets due to pricing opacity

**Our Solution:**
Partner with WorldPosta to bring their global infrastructure to Egypt while building a local team that understands Egyptian business needs. Then, break industry norms by publishing transparent pricing and guaranteeing ROI.

**Since Our Founding:**
- Served [XX]+ Egyptian businesses across 6 industries
- Migrated [XX]+ companies to our cloud platform with zero downtime
- Achieved [XX]% average client cost reduction in first year
- Maintained 99.9% uptime SLA across all services
