**8.Risk** **Assessment**

**Top** **5** **Risks** **to** **Project** **Success**

**Risk** **1 Pricing** **Information** **Not** **Approved** **for**
**Publication**

**Impact:** HIGH Eliminates primary competitive differentiator
**Probability:** MEDIUM Requires executive and sales leadership buy-in

**Why** **this** **matters:**

Transparent pricing is our single biggest competitive advantage. NO
competitor publishes pricing. If we cannot publish pricing, we lose 100%
differentiation in this critical area.

**Mitigation** **Strategies:**

> Present competitive analysis showing opportunity (this document) Start
> with "starting at" pricing if full pricing too sensitive Alternative:
> Focus on ROI calculator as primary differentiator
>
> Demonstrate lead qualification benefits (reduces sales time on
> unqualified leads)

**Contingency** **Plan:**

> If full pricing not approved, publish service tier comparisons without
> exact prices Emphasize ROI calculator and migration assessment tools
> instead
>
> Require pricing discussion only after ROI calculator completion
> (qualified leads)

**Risk** **2 Insufficient** **Case** **Study** **Approvals**

**Impact:** MEDIUM Reduces social proof and industry credibility
**Probability:** MEDIUM Requires client approvals, legal review

**Why** **this** **matters:**

Case studies with quantified results build trust and demonstrate
expertise. Target: 3 5 for Phase 1 launch, 10 by Month 12.

**Mitigation** **Strategies:**

> Start case study approval process immediately Week 1
>
> Offer anonymized case studies ("Major Egyptian Bank" vs. named client)
> Incentivize clients (co-marketing, featured partner program)
>
> Use mix of detailed case studies + brief testimonials

**Contingency** **Plan:**

> Launch with minimum 2 case studies (better than none) Supplement with
> testimonials and client logo grid Prioritize new case study
> development in Phase 2

**Risk** **3 Content** **Creation** **Delays**

**Impact:** MEDIUM Delays Phase 2 launch, reduces SEO impact

**Probability:** MEDIUM Dependent on content writer availability,
approval workflow

**Why** **this** **matters:**

Content marketing (blog, resources) drives organic traffic and thought
leadership. Delays reduce competitive advantage window.

**Mitigation** **Strategies:**

> Assign dedicated content writer (internal or agency) in Week 1
>
> Create content calendar with firm deadlines Week 6
>
> Provide content templates (structure, SEO guidelines, length) Build
> buffer time into timeline 6 weeks vs. 4 weeks minimum)

**Contingency** **Plan:**

> Use guest posts from partners WorldPosta, technology vendors) Curate
> and comment on industry content initially
>
> Reduce publishing frequency temporarily 1x/week vs. 2x/week)

**Risk** **4 Insufficient** **Lead** **Generation**

**Impact:** HIGH Business objectives not met, ROI questioned
**Probability:** LOW MEDIUM Mitigated by competitive differentiation

**Why** **this** **matters:**

Project success measured by lead generation. If targets not met 50
leads/month by Month 6 , ROI questioned.

**Mitigation** **Strategies:**

> Set realistic expectations with stakeholders (this document provides
> targets) Focus on lead quality over quantity (qualified leads more
> valuable) Continuous optimization A/B testing, conversion rate
> optimization)
>
> Multi-channel lead capture ROI calculator, whitepapers, contact forms)

**Contingency** **Plan:**

> If below target after Month 3, accelerate content marketing 4x/week
> blog) Invest in paid advertising Google Ads for high-intent keywords)
>
> Optimize conversion funnels (reduce friction, improve CTAs, simplify
> forms)

**Risk** **5 Competitor** **Reaction** **Copying** **Transparent**
**Pricing)**

**Impact:** MEDIUM Competitive advantage reduced over time
**Probability:** MEDIUM HIGH Expected within 12 18 months

**Why** **this** **matters:**

First-mover advantage in transparent pricing temporary. Competitors will
notice and may copy approach.

**Mitigation** **Strategies:**

> Launch quickly to establish first-mover advantage
>
> Build content moat 2x/week blog creates 100 posts before competitors
> react)
>
> Deepen differentiation Egypt-specific expertise, WorldPosta
> partnership, better tools)
>
> Focus on execution excellence (faster, better UX, superior content)

**Contingency** **Plan:**

> If competitors copy pricing, differentiate on:
>
> Better interactive tools (more sophisticated calculators) Superior
> content (higher quality, more frequent) Stronger case studies (more
> detailed, more industries) Better user experience (faster, more
> intuitive)
>
> Emphasize local expertise and WorldPosta partnership (harder to copy)

**Additional** **Risks** **(Lower** **Priority)**

**Performance** **Targets** **Not** **Met:** Mitigated by dedicated
optimization sprint Week 9 , modern tech stack Next.js, Vercel CDN ,
regular Lighthouse audits

**Third-Party** **Integration** **Failures:** Mitigated by proven
integrations HubSpot API, Mailchimp, common tools), fallback options,

**Conclusion**

**The** **Opportunity**

We have a rare 12 18 month window to establish Roaya IT as Egypt's most
transparent, customer-centric IT services provider before competitors
react. The market analysis is clear: NO competitor publishes pricing, NO
competitor has interactive tools, and ALL competitors have weak content
marketing.

**The** **Investment**

Modest compared to the opportunity: 100,000 EGP Year 1 total investment
(if content outsourced) generates an estimated 5,000,000 EGP pipeline
through improved lead generation and sales efficiency.

**The** **Risk**

The biggest risk is NOT acting: competitors will eventually discover
transparent pricing and interactive tools. Our competitive advantage
window is finite. The second-biggest risk is delaying the pricing
transparency decision - it's our primary differentiator.

**The** **Decision**

**We** **need** **executive** **approval** **to** **proceed** **with:**

>  **Pricing** **transparency** (full or partial) GO/NO GO decision
>
>  **Budget** **authorization** 54,000 66,000 EGP Year 1 recurring
> costs)  **Team** **assignments** (internal allocation or external
> resources)
>
>  **Timeline** **commitment** 10-week launch target)

**The** **Outcome**

**If** **approved** **today,** **in** **10** **weeks** **we** **will**
**have:**

> Egypt's first transparent IT services pricing website LIVE
>
> Interactive ROI calculator generating qualified leads automatically
> Modern, fast, mobile-optimized website showcasing our expertise
> Foundation for 100 monthly leads within 12 months

**The** **choice** **is** **clear:** Lead the market or follow
competitors.
